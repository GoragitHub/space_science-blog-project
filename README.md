# space_science-django-blog-project
 This is a Django blog project. I've used templates from here-"https://freewebsitetemplates.com/". Here I've done the  blog post and contact form dynamic. You just need to clone the repository or download the project, go through the code(easy to understand by any fresher developer) and then you can write blog posts.
